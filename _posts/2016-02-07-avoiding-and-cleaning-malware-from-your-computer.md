# **Avoiding and Cleaning Malware from your Computer**

When a window pops up that you are not certain about its origins, there are two ways to safely close it.  If it has a corresponding item on the Task Bar, you can right-click on that 'bar' and click on Close. If it does not show on the task bar, the best thing to do is save any work, and log off. Logging off will close any running programs, including whatever caused the pop up. Then, when you log back in, I would run a quick Ccleaner/Malwarebytes scan just to be safe. If you catch any changes it made before it really gets a hold of your system, it is much easier to take care of.

Ccleaner ([www.ccleaner.com][0]) (which will redirect you to[http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner][1]) is a program that deletes all the temporary internet and operating system files from your computer. This includes emptying the recycle bin, so make sure there is nothing in there that you want saved! After clicking on Download, the screen to the left will appear (within the browser). I always choose "Download from Piriform.com".

Malwarebytes ([www.malwarebytes.org][2]) (which sends you to one of several download sites) is a program that removes harmful adware and spyware (collectively called malware).

If you are using IE, you can run the files directly from the download. However, if you do this, do not run either program after the install is finished. If you are using Firefox, you can download each program, then run them from the downloads window (as shown to the left).

If your system is older, you may want to invest the time to run a defrag. If you go to[http://www.defraggler.com][3](again, this will redirect you to a piriform.com page). This can be easily scheduled to defrag your hard drive once a month. It is not a bad idea. If you have any questions, or need us to help you download and install it, and show you how to configure it, please call us at 1-609-744-0923, or visit our website ([http://www.mmeyerconsulting.com][4]).

I recommend that you run ccleaner and malwarebytes every two weeks. This does two things. It keeps the temporary files cleared out, and it updates malwarebytes (which must be done manually). Following are the steps to running the two programs.

1. Run CCleaner (large Red 'C' icon). If it has not been previously configured, I usually uncheck the Cookies, History, and Downloads History for any of the browsers (Internet Explorer is on the first page, Firefox, Safari and others will be under the Applications tab). Cookies are not usually destructive, and store settings for web pages that you may use frequently. History allows you to find that website you visited last week, but can't remember the URL. Download History is for Firefox, and it stores your previously downloaded programs and documents.
  1. When it is configured, click on 'Run Cleaner'. If it pops up a box telling you it is going to permanently delete files from your computer, I put a checkmark in the box 'Do not show me this message again, then click on Ok.
  2. Once CCleaner finishes, it is time to run Malwarebytes. The reason to run CCleaner first is that it deletes a lot of the files that Malwarebytes scans, so Malwarebytes won't have to scan them. They are all temporary files. It does not delete any data or program files.

1. Run Malwarebytes Anti-Malware.
  1. Before doing anything else, click on the Update tab, and then click on Check for Updates button. Malwarebytes will check for any updates and install them. This is important, so that it has the latest definitions when you run it.
  2. Also, if you keep Malwarebytes close to current, if for some reason it can't download updates, it will still be relatively current, and can probably get most of the malware that is possibly on your system.
  3. Once it is updated, go back to the Scanner tab, make sure Perform Quick Scan is selected, and then click on the Scan button.
  4. If Malwarebytes finds any malicious software, it will turn the Objects Infected red, and there will be a red number next to that, which indicates how many infected items it has found.
  5. When Malwarebytes finishes it does one of two things.
  6. If no malicious items were found, it pops up a message that states that, and a notepad file that is a log of what it did. You can safely close the notepad file, and exit Malwarebytes.
  7. If there were problems, it pops up a message, and states that it found X number of infected objects.
  8. At this point, you should click on the Show Results button (lower right). When you do that, a window opens that shows all the items Malwarebytes found, each with a big, green checkmark next to it. You should click on the Remove Selected button (lower left), and Malwarebytes will remove the registry settings, and files that are bad.
  9. If Malwarebytes says it needs to reboot to fix anything, it is HIGHLY recommended that you do so immediately. Hopefully, you were not working on anything that needs to be saved. If you were, save it quickly, and let Malwarebytes reboot your system.
